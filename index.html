                    As a small child I was always fiddling with something. Small pieces of wood, plastic, and metal always held my attention because I could see
                    future possiblities for each item. Eventually, imagining those possibilites led me to take wood shop in High school. A teacher noticed
                    that my hands were very steady when creating detail work or using the class machines. He suggested I look at some of the technical courses
                    offered by the school district. I took an electrical class, really enjoyed it, and started seeing lots of possibilities for my future. 
                    I decided to start by obtaining IPC-620 and J-Standard certification. I thought of starting the journey to be an electrician but when my wife & I needed
                    a computer that could hold lots of storage and I couldn't find anything to fit our needs I decided to try building one. It was incredibly fun.
                    Suddenly,  wondered if I can build this what else can I learn about computers?
